## ðŸ§® Data and Summary Table

# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)  # for pretty tables

# Example data
doses <- tibble::tibble(
  exposed = c("Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","No"),
  completed_series = c(1,1,0,0,1,0)
)

# Summarize completion rate by exposure group
summary_table <- doses %>%
  group_by(exposed) %>%
  summarise(completion_rate = mean(completed_series) * 100,
            .groups = "drop")

# Display table
knitr::kable(summary_table, digits = 1,
             col.names = c("Exposed", "Completion Rate (%)"))
