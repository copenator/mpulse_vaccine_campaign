## ðŸ§®

## ðŸ§® Data and Summary Table

```{r}
# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)  # for kable() pretty tables

# Example dataset
doses <- tibble::tibble(
  exposed = c("Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","No"),
  completed_series = c(1,1,0,0,1,0)
)

# Summarize completion rate by exposure
summary_table <- doses %>%
  group_by(exposed) %>%
  summarise(completion_rate = mean(completed_series) * 100, .groups = "drop")

# 1) Always shows (raw print of the tibble)
summary_table

# Markdown table (renders in HTML/PDF/Word without raw HTML)
knitr::kable(summary_table, digits = 1)

```
